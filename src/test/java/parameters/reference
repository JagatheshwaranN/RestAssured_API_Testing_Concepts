multiPart() and formParam() are not the same in RestAssured
===========================================================
multiPart() method:
===================
multiPart() is used for sending multipart/form-data requests, typically used when uploading
files through a form.
It is used in scenarios where you want to simulate the process of submitting a form that
includes files to be uploaded.
This method is often used in combination with the .post() or .put() methods when you need
to upload files along with other form data.

RestAssured.given()
    .multiPart("file", new File("/path/to/file.txt"))
    .formParam("param1", "value1")
    .formParam("param2", "value2")
    .when()
    .post("/upload");

formParam() method:
===================
formParam() is used for sending form parameters in the request body, typically when making
POST or PUT requests with form data.
It is used to set key-value pairs of form parameters.
This method is commonly used when you need to submit data in a request body in a format
similar to submitting an HTML form.

RestAssured.given()
    .formParam("param1", "value1")
    .formParam("param2", "value2")
    .when()
    .post("/submitForm");

In summary, multiPart() is primarily used for file uploads, while formParam() is used for
sending form parameters in the request body. Depending on your use case, you may use one or
both methods in a given request.
