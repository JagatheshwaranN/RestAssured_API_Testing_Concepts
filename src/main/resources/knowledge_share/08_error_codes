=========

1. What are the common HTTP error codes encountered in REST API testing?
Common HTTP error codes encountered in REST API testing include
1. 400 Bad Request,
2. 401 Unauthorized,
3. 404 Not Found,
4. 500 Internal Server Error, and
5. 503 Service Unavailable,
Each error code signifies a different type of problem encountered during the API request-response
cycle.

2. What strategies do you employ to troubleshoot and debug errors related to HTTP status codes
in REST Assured tests?
To troubleshoot and debug errors related to HTTP status codes in REST Assured tests, I typically employ
the following strategies:
1. Reviewing the test code to ensure that the correct endpoint is being tested.
2. Inspecting the API documentation to verify the expected behavior and error codes.
3. Logging the request and response details to analyze the actual HTTP status code and response body.

3. What are the common 4xx Client Error codes seen in testing?
1. 400 Bad Request: The server cannot process the request due to client error, such as invalid syntax
or missing parameters in the request.
2. 401 Unauthorized: The request requires user authentication. The client must provide valid credentials
(e.g., username and password) to access the resource.
3. 403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it. The client does not
have sufficient permissions to access the requested resource.
4. 404 Not Found: The server cannot find the requested resource. It may be temporarily unavailable or may
have been moved to a different location.

4. What are the common 5xx Server Error codes seen in testing?
1. 500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message indicating that something went wrong on the
server-side, but the server is unable to specify the exact cause of the error.
2. 502 Bad Gateway: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server while acting
as a gateway or proxy.
3. 503 Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request due to maintenance,
overload, or other transient conditions.
4. 504 Gateway Timeout: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely
response from the upstream server.

5. What are the common 2xx Success codes seen in testing?
1. 200 OK: The request was successful. This is the most common successful code.
2. 201 Created: The request resulted in a new resource being created.
3. 202 Accepted: The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been
completed.

6. What are the common 3xx Redirection codes seen in testing?
1. 301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
2. 302 Found: The requested resource can be found at a different URL (typically used for
temporary redirects).
3. 304 Not Modified: The resource has not been modified since the last time it was accessed
by the client.

7. What are the common 1xx Informational codes seen in testing?
These codes indicate the request is being processed and further action might be needed. You
typically won't see these directly in a browser.
