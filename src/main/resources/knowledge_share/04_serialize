Questions
=========

1. What is serialization and deserialization in Rest Assured testing?
Serialization: The process of converting a Java object (representing request data) into a format
suitable for transmission over a network (e.g., JSON, XML).
Deserialization: The reverse process of converting the received response payload (often in JSON
or XML) back into a Java object for easier manipulation and assertion within your tests.

2. Why is serialization and deserialization important in Rest Assured testing?
Serialization and deserialization allow Rest Assured to send and receive complex Java objects as part
of HTTP requests and responses, enabling testing of APIs that exchange data in formats like JSON or XML.

3. How can you serialize a Java object into JSON using Rest Assured?
Rest Assured provides the .body() method to specify the request payload. If you pass a Java object
directly, Rest Assured will automatically serialize it into JSON.
MyObject obj = new MyObject("John", 30);
RestAssured.given().contentType(ContentType.JSON)
        .body(obj)
        .post("https://api.example.com/resource");

4. How do you deserialize a JSON response into a Java object using Rest Assured?
Rest Assured provides the .as() method to deserialize the response body into a Java object of the
specified type.
Response response = RestAssured.get("https://api.example.com/resource");
MyObject responseObject = response.as(MyObject.class);

5. What is the benefit of deserializing JSON responses into Java objects in Rest Assured testing?
Deserializing JSON responses into Java objects allows for easy access to specific data elements within
the response, simplifying validation and assertion tasks.

6. How do you handle nested JSON structures during deserialization in Rest Assured?
Rest Assured automatically handles nested JSON structures during deserialization by mapping nested JSON
objects to corresponding nested Java objects.

7. Explain the concept of custom serializers and deserializers in Rest Assured.
Custom serializers and deserializers allow you to customize the serialization and deserialization process,
such as handling date formats or converting custom data types.

8. How can you implement a custom serializer in Rest Assured?
You can implement a custom serializer by extending the Serializer class and overriding its methods to
customize the serialization process according to your requirements.

9. How can you implement a custom deserializer in Rest Assured?
You can implement a custom deserializer by extending the Deserializer class and overriding its methods to
customize the deserialization process according to your requirements.

10. What are the common libraries or frameworks used for serialization and deserialization in Rest
Assured testing?
Common libraries or frameworks used for serialization and deserialization in Rest Assured testing include
Gson, Jackson, and Apache Commons BeanUtils.

11. How do you handle XML serialization and deserialization in Rest Assured testing?
Rest Assured supports XML serialization and deserialization similarly to JSON. You can use the
.contentType(ContentType.XML) method to specify XML content type for serialization and the .as() method
with the appropriate Java class for deserialization.

12. What are some alternatives to POJOs for deserialization?
HashMaps: Can be used for simpler responses, but lack type safety and clarity compared to POJOs.
Groovy Expressions: Offer flexibility for complex assertions, but might be less readable for large
datasets.

13. How do you handle scenarios where the response structure might change?
1. Matchers: Use powerful matchers like hasKey(), hasItem(), or containsString() to assert specific
elements within the response, even if the overall structure changes slightly.
2. JsonIgnoreProperties: Annotate specific fields in your POJO class with @JsonIgnoreProperties to
ignore unexpected fields in the response that might break deserialization.

14. Give me an example for serialization using explicit Jackson Databind library?
Serialize a Java object and include it in the request payload using Rest Assured.

public class RestAssuredSerializationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        MyObject obj = new MyObject("John", 30);
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        String jsonPayload = mapper.writeValueAsString(obj);

        RestAssured.given().contentType(ContentType.JSON)
                .body(jsonPayload)
                .post("https://api.example.com/user");
    }
}

15. Give me an example for Deserialization using explicit Jackson Databind library?
Deserialize the JSON response payload into a Java object using Rest Assured.

public class RestAssuredDeserializationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Response response = RestAssured.get("https://api.example.com/user");
        String jsonResponse = response.getBody().asString();
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        MyObject responseObject = mapper.readValue(jsonResponse, MyObject.class);
        System.out.println("Deserialized Object: " + responseObject);
    }
}
