Questions
=========

1. What is proxy testing in Rest Assured API Testing?
Proxy testing in Rest Assured involves configuring Rest Assured to route API requests through a proxy
server for debugging, monitoring, or security purposes.

2. How do you configure proxy settings in Rest Assured?
You can configure proxy settings in Rest Assured using the .proxy() method.

3. Explain the parameters of the .proxy() method in Rest Assured.
The .proxy() method in Rest Assured accepts parameters such as proxy host, proxy port, and optionally
username and password for proxy authentication.

4. How do you configure Rest Assured to use a proxy server without authentication?
RestAssured.proxy("proxy.example.com", 8080);

5. How do you configure Rest Assured to use a proxy server with authentication?
RestAssured.proxy("proxy.example.com", 8080, "username", "password");

6. What precautions should be taken when using proxy servers in API testing?
When using proxy servers in API testing, it's important to ensure that sensitive data such as
authentication tokens or personally identifiable information (PII) is not leaked or intercepted.
Additionally, proper authentication and authorization mechanisms should be in place to prevent
unauthorized access to the proxy server.

7. What is Proxy Testing in the context of Rest Assured?
Proxy testing involves configuring Rest Assured to send requests through a proxy server. This
allows you to:
Monitor API traffic: Inspect request and response data flowing between your tests and the API.
Debug network issues: Identify potential problems like timeouts or connection errors.
Simulate network conditions: Set up delays or modify requests to test API behavior under
specific network scenarios.

8. How do you configure RestAssured to use a proxy server?
There are two main approaches:
Static Proxy: Specify the proxy host and port directly in your code.
RestAssured.proxy("localhost", 8080);

Proxy Specification: Create a more flexible ProxySpecification object with additional details
like username, password, and proxy type.
ProxySpecification proxySpec = new ProxySpecification("localhost", 8080, "http")
  .username("proxy_user")
  .password("proxy_password");
RestAssured.given()
  .proxy(proxySpec);
