Questions
=========

1. What are parameters in API requests?
Parameters are values passed with an API request to modify the behavior of the request or to provide
additional data to the server.

2. What are the different types of parameters commonly used in API requests?
The commonly used types of parameters in API requests are:
1. Query Parameters
2. Path Parameters
3. Header Parameters
4. Form Parameters (or Request Body Parameters)
5. Cookie Parameters

3. Explain Query Parameters in API requests.
Query parameters are key-value pairs appended to the URL of an API request. They are separated from
the URL by a question mark (?) and from each other by an ampersand (&). Query parameters are used to
filter, sort, or paginate results.

4. How do you include Query Parameters in Rest Assured requests?
You can include query parameters in Rest Assured requests using the .queryParam() method.
RestAssured.given().queryParam("key", "value").get("https://api.example.com/resource");
RestAssured.given()
  .baseUri("https://api.example.com/users")
  .queryParam("limit", 10)  // Limit results to 10
  .queryParam("sort", "name")  // Sort by name
  ...

5. Explain Path Parameters in API requests.
Path parameters are placeholders in the URL path of an API request. They are used to specify variable
parts of the URL, such as IDs or names, which are replaced with actual values when making the request.

6. How do you include Path Parameters in Rest Assured requests?
You can include path parameters in Rest Assured requests by using the .pathParam() method.
RestAssured.given().pathParam("id", "123").get("https://api.example.com/resource/{id}");
RestAssured.given()
  .baseUri("https://api.example.com/users/{userId}")
  .pathParam("userId", 123)  // Replace with specific user ID
  ...

7. What are Header Parameters in API requests?
Header parameters are key-value pairs included in the request headers. They provide additional
information to the server, such as authentication credentials, content type, or custom metadata.

8. How do you include Header Parameters in Rest Assured requests?
You can include header parameters in Rest Assured requests using the .header() method.
RestAssured.given().header("Authorization", "Bearer token").get("https://api.example.com/resource");

9. Explain Form Parameters (or Request Body Parameters) in API requests.
Form parameters, also known as request body parameters, are data sent in the body of an HTTP request,
typically in POST or PUT requests. They are used to send complex data structures or larger amounts
of data.

10. How do you include Form Parameters in Rest Assured requests?
You can include form parameters in Rest Assured requests using the .formParam() method.
RestAssured.given().formParam("username", "john").formParam("password", "secret").post("https://api.
example.com/login");

11. What are Cookie Parameters in API requests?
Cookie parameters are key-value pairs stored in the client's browser and sent with each request to
the server. They are used for maintaining session state or passing user-specific information.

12. How do you include Cookie Parameters in Rest Assured requests?
You can include cookie parameters in Rest Assured requests using the .cookie() method.
RestAssured.given().cookie("session_id", "abc123").get("https://api.example.com/resource");

13. What are MultiPart Parameters in API requests?
The multiPart() method in Rest Assured is used to include multipart/form-data parameters in API
requests. This method is particularly useful when uploading files or sending binary data along
with other form fields in an HTTP request.

14. How do you include MultiPart Parameters in Rest Assured requests?
You can include multiPart parameters in Rest Assured requests using the .multiPart() method.
RestAssured.given()
    .multiPart("file", new File("/path/to/file.txt")) // Upload a file
    .multiPart("field1", "value1") // Additional form field
    .multiPart("field2", "value2") // Additional form field
    .post("https://api.example.com/upload");

15. What are the main types of parameters used in RESTful APIs?
There are two primary types:
Query Parameters: Appended to the URL after a question mark (?) and consist of key-value pairs
separated by ampersands (&). They are used to filter, sort, or paginate data.
Path Parameters: Embedded within the URL path itself, enclosed in curly braces {}. They represent
specific resource identifiers within the API endpoint.

16. When would you use query parameters vs. path parameters?
Query parameters: Ideal for filtering, sorting, pagination, or any options that can vary across
requests.
Path parameters: Used to identify specific resources within the API structure (e.g., user ID,
product ID).
